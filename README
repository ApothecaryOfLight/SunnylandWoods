AssetID - Unique for each frame
ObjectID - Unique for each gameworld object, so each Croc gets its own ObjectID, which is retired upon being killed and reissued when a new enemy/w/e is spawned.
		ObjectID sets are self-contained, so EnemyID1 is not MapObjectID1.
SectorFormat - Each object manager will store a SectorFormat with the following universal fields:
	ObjectID	AssetID		XPos		YPos		XSector		YSector		CurrentFrame	MaxFrames	varies
		Fields after MaxFrames vary based upon which Manager.
AssetIDs map to a list of all assets
	AssetID+CurrentFrame=OffsetPosition		XSize		YSize

Collisions

Objects
Clickables		PLUS CLICKABLES THAT ARENT CLICKABLE, LIKE MENU LOADING BAR
	EACH CLICKABLE CALLS UPON ARRAY OF HARDCODED FUNCTIONS AND CONDITIONALS
	SO YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THE APPEARANCE AND PLACEMENT OF BUTTONS
	BUT YOU CAN'T CREATE CONDITIONALS OR EFFECTS
	ONLY CHOOSE MULTIPLE CONDITIONALS AND EFFECTS FROM A DROPDOWN
Collectibles
Interactables

XML levels
Use CMake
Map Editor
Merge MainMenu and GameInterface
Versioning

All entities will be composed of collision boxes based on their pixels

-WAY TO CREATE BOUNDING BOXES DYNAMICALLY USING PIXEL TESTING!?

-ABILITY TO DRAW BOUNDING BOXES ON SCREEN (F4)

-Ability to have differently sized animations and variables capable of centering them and being accounted for in collisions.

-Collisions with enemies- SIDE, BELOW or FROM ABOVE
-Collisions with interactables- SIDE, BELOW, or FROM ABOVE
-Collision with terrains- SIDE, BELOW, or FROM ABOVE
-Collision with collectibles- IMPACT


FACTORY TO CREATE ASSETS
	-File name
	-Calculate bounding boxes based on pixels FOR EACH FRAME
	-Allocate and destroy all data appropriately
	-On shutdown deallocate the buffers etc.
	-Needs to handle static images and multiframe animations
